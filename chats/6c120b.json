So instead of getting something new with the same old money, you need even more coins to buy the same toy. It's kind of like when mommy says she needs more coins to pay for groceries - we call that price inflation."

        "content": "Quantum entanglement is a very strange phenomenon in which two particles become connected in such a way that their states (like position, momentum, etc.) cannot be described independently of each other. No matter how far apart these particles are, if you measure one particle's state, you will instantly know the state of the other particle. This spooky action at a distance has been observed many times in experiments using photons (particles of light) or electrons. However, it remains one of the most mysterious and counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics."

If they're special enough, no matter where they are or how far apart they are, if you wave Wand A this way, Wand B will automatically do the exact opposite move without you having to think about it. That's what quantum entanglement is like \u2013 the magical connection between two things that makes them act together even when separated by huge distances. But remember, just because it happens magically, scientists still don\u2019t fully understand why it works, so there\u2019s lots left to learn!"
